# original work: https://github.com/graphite-project/whisper/issues/22

# whisper-fill: unlike whisper-merge, don't overwrite data that's
# already present in the target file, but instead, only add the missing
# data (e.g. where the gaps in the target file are).  Because no values
# are overwritten, no data or precision gets lost.  Also, unlike
# whisper-merge, try to take the highest-precision archive to provide
# the data, instead of the one with the largest retention.
# Using this script, reconciliation between two replica instances can be
# performed by whisper-fill-ing the data of the other replica with the
# data that exists locally, without introducing the quite remarkable
# gaps that whisper-merge leaves behind (filling a higher precision
# archive with data from a lower precision one)

# Work performed by author while working at Booking.com.
